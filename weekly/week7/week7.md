#### Image quality assessment based on downstream object detection
One of the objectives of the thesis is to set the ground truth quality for an image based on the result of downstream object detection. I wrote about two potential problems with this approach at [this link](../../Ideas/object_detection/object_detection.md).

There is some research on the topic but it's unclear if anything is applicable to my thesis. This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04359) introduced a IQA metric based on downstream machine learning tasks. However, it was done for image segmentation/classification for medical images. I don't know if it's possible to adjust the method to suit our needs. This paper [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14258) takes a similar approach with an IQA metric based on a downstream task. It's also unclear if this will help us in any way.
