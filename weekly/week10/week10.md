### Week 10 10-14 Mar

This week I am continuing with the pre-study which means that I won't be doing too much coding. However, I did just complete an analysis on how the IQA metrics perform on non-weather related distortions. The results of the analysis can be found [here](../../Code/iqa_non_weather_distortions/iqa_non_weather_distortions.md). The other code thing I'm working on at the moment is looking into potential PCQA metrics to use in the evaluation.
