### Results of IQA techniques on 0-100 rain noise

In this experiment, 100 versions of the same image is captured with progressively increasing rain noise. The exact noise of each of the versions can be found [here](file_to_config.json).

The resulting scores, SPRCSs, and Kendall's tau can be found at the links below. `liqe_mix` was excluded from the experiment because it hung the execution `qualiclip` and `qualiclip+` were excluded since they werenâ€™t in the release of torch-iqa that I have.
