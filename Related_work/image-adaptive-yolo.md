### Image-Adaptive YOLO for Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08088

**Summary:**
The authors tackle the problem of real time object detection (YOLO) in adverse weather conditions. Their solution consists of creating a differentiable image processing (DIP) module that can enhance image quality and remove weather related noise before sending it to YOLO. The results are very promising.
