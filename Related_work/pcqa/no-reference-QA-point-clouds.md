### No-Reference Quality Assessment for 3D Colored Point Cloud and Mesh Models
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02041

**Summary:**
Most point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) research is full-reference (FR), meaning that measuring the quality of a distorted point cloud requires a reference point cloud. Also, other research usually disregard color information in point clouds. This paper introduces a no reference (NR) PCQA which takes color information into account. The model can also deal with meshes. 

It works by transforming the 3D models into "quality-related geometry and color feature domains. Then, the 3D natural scene statistics (3D-NSS) and entropy
are utilized to extract quality-aware features. Finally, a support
vector regression (SVR) model is employed to regress the qualityaware features into visual quality scores." (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02041)
