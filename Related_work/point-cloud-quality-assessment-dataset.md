### Point Cloud Quality Assessment: Dataset Construction and Learning-based No-Reference Metric

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11895

**Summary:**
In this paper, the authors construct LS-PCQA, a PCQA dataset containing 104 reference point clouds and more than 22 000 distorted samples. The authors distort the reference point clouds with 31 types of impairments at 7 different levels. In addition to this, the authors also propose ReSCNN, a NR metric based on a CNN to estimate the subjective quality of a point cloud. Results are promising when compared to other SOTA FR and NR models.
