### HDC-MiniROCKET: Explicit Time Encoding in Time Series Classification with Hyperdimensional Computing

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08055

ROCKET is a CNN model architecture designed for classifying time-series data. MiniROCKET is a reimplementation of Rocket that can be up to 75 times faster on some datasets, yet has roughly the same accuracy. This paper introduces HDC-MiniROCKET which combines MiniROCKET with hyperdimensional computing mechanisms. The result is a generalized version of MiniROCKET which can overcome the failings of MiniROCKET and perform better on datasets with high temporal dependence. This comes at no extra cost in computational effort for inference.
