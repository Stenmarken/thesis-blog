### Joint Geometry and Color Projection-based Point Cloud Quality Metric
Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02481

**Summary:**
This paper goes beyond projection-based metrics common in PCQA research and instead does a joint approach of geometry and color projection-based PCQA. This solves the problem of the misalignment between reference and degraded projected images. Note that this approach is FR and not NR. Results shown are very promising.
