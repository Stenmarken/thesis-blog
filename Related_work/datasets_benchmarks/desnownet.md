### DesnowNet: Context-Aware Deep Network for Snow Removal

Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04512

In this article, the authors present a novel way of removing snow particles from images. In addition, the authors introduce the Snow100K dataset, a large dataset of raw images and the raw images with artificial snow particles added to them. The snowy images look quite nice. This could be an alternative to using albumentations.
