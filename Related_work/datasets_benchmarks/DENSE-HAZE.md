### DENSE-HAZE: A BENCHMARK FOR IMAGE DEHAZING WITH DENSE-HAZE AND HAZE-FREE IMAGES

Link: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire19//dense-haze/

This dataset contains pairs of images where each pair contains a natural image and an image with haze added with a haze machine. I don't think this work will be very useful in my research. The problem is that there is no way of determining the quality of the hazy images or the ranking of them since the researchers don't seem to specify the exact amount of haziness in each image.
