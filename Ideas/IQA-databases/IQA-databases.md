# IQA databases

There exists a wide range of image databases for training and testing the performance of FR and NR IQA techniques. The following is a short summary of the main ones:

## Synthetic distortions

### LIVE dataset

The LIVE dataset consists of 779 distorted images derived from 29 high-quality ones. The dataset uses 5 distortion types: JPEG2000 compression, JP2K (JPEG compression), white noise (WN), Gaussian Blur, and Fast Fading (FF). Each distortion type is applied at 4 or 5 intensity levels.

### CSIQ dataset

The CSIQ dataset consists of 30 reference images and 866 distorted images that have been distorted using 6 disortion types. The distortion types are: JPEG, JP2K, GB, global contrast decrements, and additive pink GN.

### KADID-10K

KADID-10K contains 81 high-quality reference images and roughly 10 000 distorted images with 25 different distortion types. Each distortion type has five levels.

### TID2008/TID2013

TID2008 contains 25 reference images with 1700 distorted images that has over 17 distortion types. TID2013 is an extension of TID2008 with 3000 distorted images using 24 distortion types.

### PIPAL

PIPAL is an IQA dataset aimed at improving and testing IQA algorithms on image quality restoration. It has 250 reference images, 40 distortion types, 29 000 distortion images, and over 1 million human ratings.

## Authentic distortions

### CLIVE dataset

This dataset includes 1162 authentically distorted images from a variety of real-world scenarios. The resolutions of the images range from 500 x 500 to 640 x 960 pixels.

### SPAQ

SPAQ is a NR-IQA dataset specifically aimed at training and testing IQA algorithms on smartphone images. It has 11,125 images using 66 different smartphone cameras taken in different settings.

### AVA dataset

AVA is a dataset released by Google that consists of so called atomic visual actions. It is a dataset of people in youtube videos where the bounding box of the person, their pose, and their interactions with objects/other persons have been annotated.

### FLIVE/PaQ-2-PiQ

The FLIVE dataset is a large-scale authentically distorted dataset from the FLICKR website. It has 39 810 images with a large variety of scenes and content. The distortions present are introduced authentically and includies motion blur, defocus blur, overexposure, and compression artefacts.

### KonIQ-10K

KonIQ-10K consists of 10 073 authentically distorted images taken from the internet. Covers a wide range of distortions and scenes.
